# Welcome!

This Haskell template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example. If it is your first contribution then you should have a look at the [Getting Started](https://tech.io/doc/getting-started-create-playground) document.


The source code isn't on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechDotIO/haskell-template), but please feel free to come up with proposals to improve it anyway.

# Bonjour Haskell
